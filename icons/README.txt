Icon placeholders:

To complete the extension, add icon images:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create simple icons using any image editor or online icon generator.

Suggested design: A folder icon with a GitHub Actions symbol (or just a simple folder).

For now, the extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a warning.
