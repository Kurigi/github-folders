## Installation

### From Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon)

*Extension will be available on the Chrome Web Store soon.*

### Load Locally

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top right)
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `github-actions-folders` directory
5. Visit any GitHub Actions page to see it in action!

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Extension Button

1. Visit your repository's Actions page
2. If you have write access, you'll see a **"Create Config File"** button
3. Click it to create a template config file with example folders
4. Edit the file to organize your workflows

### Option 2: Create Manually

Create a file at `.github/actions-folders.json` in your repository:

```json
{
  "folders": [
    {
      "name": "Build & Test",
      "workflows": ["ci.yml", "test.yml"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Deployment",
      "workflows": ["deploy-prod.yml", "deploy-staging.yml"]
    }
  ]
}
```

That's it! Visit your repository's Actions page and your workflows will be organized into folders.

**Notes:**
- Use just the workflow filename (e.g., `ci.yml`), not the full path
- Workflows not in any folder will appear in "Uncategorized"
- Click folder headers to expand/collapse them
- Use the toggle button (bottom of sidebar) to enable/disable per repository

## Optional: GitHub API Token

The extension works without a token, but adding one gives you better rate limits (5,000/hour vs 60/hour) and more reliable performance for private repositories.

**To add a token:** Click the extension icon ‚Üí "Open Settings" ‚Üí follow the instructions in the options page.

## Example

See it in action: [GitHub Folders Actions](https://github.com/Kurigi/github-folders/actions)

## Troubleshooting

**Extension not working?**
- Make sure you're on a GitHub Actions page (`github.com/*/actions`)
- Check that `.github/actions-folders.json` exists in your repository
- Verify the JSON syntax is valid

**Config not loading?**
- File must be on your default branch (`main` or `master`)
- For private repos, make sure you're logged into GitHub
- Try clearing the cache: Click extension icon ‚Üí "Open Settings" ‚Üí "Clear All Cache"

**Workflows not showing in folders?**
- Workflow filenames are case-sensitive
- Make sure filenames match exactly with your `.github/workflows/` files

## Options & Settings

Click the extension icon and select **"Open Settings"** to:
- Add an optional GitHub API token for better performance
- View all repositories with saved folder states
- Clear folder states for specific repositories
- Clear all cached config files

## Privacy & Security

- ‚úÖ Only runs on GitHub Actions pages
- ‚úÖ No data sent to external servers
- ‚úÖ Optional API token (stored securely in Chrome's encrypted storage)
- ‚úÖ Config files cached locally in your browser
- ‚úÖ All data stays local - nothing sent to third parties
